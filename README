                         David's Versioning System

This project aims to be a Distributed Version Control System similar to GIT
but with a SANE command line interface (CLI).

Initial sub-commands:

- init     - Initialize working copy.
- checkout - Checkout branch / tag.
- commit   - Commit changes from working copy.
- fetch    - Fetch from server.
- pull     - Pull from server.
- push     - Push to server.
- status   - Print status.
